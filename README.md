# Named Entity Recognizer (NER) Wrapper
A C# wrapper around the [Stanford NER processor](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html) that uses Machine Learning to identify words in a collection of sentences. Stanford has an online demo of some of their pre-made models [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/ner).

### Requirements:
- Java installed and on `PATH`
- `stanford-ner.jar` (included with release)

### How to Use:
1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/derekantrican/NERWrapper/releases)
2. Reference the `NERWrapper.dll`
3. Look at the [Demo project](https://github.com/derekantrican/NERWrapper/blob/master/NERDemo/Program.cs) and see the example usage. The Demo project also includes example files (the same files that are used as an example on Stanford's website).
